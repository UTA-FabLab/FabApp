Operational Software for any FabLab or makerspace

FabApp was designed as a scalable, open-source system to both address the needs of the UTA FabLab and the needs of both our FabLab and for any makerspace around the world. 

FabApp supports 3D printing management (via OctoPuppet), training requirements, and physical control for any device(via JuiceBox). Used in concert with the many tools native to it, FabApp allows an organization to:

-Monitor and control all equipment

-Create/manage wait queues for machines

-Track storage of completed objects for its users

-Track how much users owe the organization

-Track how much money has been charged through various means

-Mediate equipment access through the ability to set training requirements

-Manage inventory

-Submit trouble tickets

-Differentiate between many levels of user privilege 

-Set access to FabApp tools based on privilege levels

We have reached a stable version, but this is always project in progress and will continue to have additional functionality added over time. Currently, our production version is V1.0.  Please stay tuned and in touch as this project matures further!
